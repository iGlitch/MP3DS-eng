Hello Player!

Thank you for being excited to try our english patch. This is the first release of the 100% done translation,
and as such it could be considered in beta-testing for now. We've tried our best to make sure all spelling, and
more importantly, game crashing bugs are fixed. So far we know that all the way up to most of Ch 5 is working without
any crashes.

IF THE GAME CRASHES: Please take note of the name of the map where you were before it crashed
	as well as the portal you tried to take that caused the game to crash.
	~IF you know how to use JKSM to export your save, if you'd like to export a copy of your
	 save file from right before where it crashed that could be helpful too.

All that having been said, we're hopeful that all bugs have been fixed, and hopefully you won't have any issues.

If you still find a crash let us know here please: https://discord.gg/xkyPhSX

If you find some broken color tags or text that goes of screen feel free to tell us what
the message said and we'll fix it quickly. Or post a screenshot that'd be even better!

Thanks again guys! We hope you have as much fun playing as we did translating this for you!
